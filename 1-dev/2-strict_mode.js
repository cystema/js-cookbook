//Javascript tolerates sloppy code
//Use strict mode to to disallow this

'use strict';

let startNumber = 10;
startnumber = 1;

//Without strict mode, a new startnumber variable will be created
//If we use strict, a ReferenceError occurs

//Examples of errors caught with strict:
//Automatic variable creation
//Duplicate variable names
//Assign values to special keywords like infinity
//Attempts to set read-only properties
//Attempts to set frozen objects

//Can also use linting tool to catch these errors
